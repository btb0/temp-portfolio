# Temporary Portfolio
This portfolio is temporary, and will be soon updated to a custom made one using React.
I had to have at least a temporary one to display to meet a deadline for part of my bootcamp.
I was unable to make one with React before this deadline as we only started learning React a few days prior
the deadline.

Temporarily using this template found on HTML5up. Credits below.

## Additions
- I customized the template to my liking with a photo of myself and several other little things added.
- Email.js to make the email contact form work without a backend.
- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/css) for programming icons
